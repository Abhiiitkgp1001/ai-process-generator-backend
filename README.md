# AI Process Generator

This is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and store process definitions. 
The application offers two modes of input for process creation: 
1. AI-assisted input (using a ChatGPT-like model)
2. Manual process definition.

Key Features:
1. AI-Assisted Process Creation:
● Users can input a description of a process in natural language.
● This input is sent to an AI model which interprets it and breaks it
down into defined steps.
● The generated steps are then displayed to the user for review and editing.
2. Manual Process Definition:
● Users have the ability to manually create, edit, or delete steps of a process.
● Functionality to reorder or shuffle steps should be available.
● Each step can include details like title, description, and any relevant metadata.
